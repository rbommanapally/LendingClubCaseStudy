# Lending Club Case Study
Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors
looking to lend money and make a return.

The project aims to identify the defaulters based on various factors. We use different analysis to scan the applicant details based on the previous records and set new rules and guidelines for the loan applicants.
